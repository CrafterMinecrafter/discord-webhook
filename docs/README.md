# discord-webhook
## Information
Just a template I use for initiating Discord webhooks.
## Instructions
This template uses node-fetch `v2.6.1` and node.js `v12.17.0`, some older versions might work.\
The required command lines are `npm ci` and `node main.js`.\
All configuration is to be placed in `src/config.json`.\
**Note:** Make sure to run the commands in the `src` folder.
